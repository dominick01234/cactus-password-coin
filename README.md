# Cactus Password Smart Coin

In this project, we develop a simple password protected Smart Coin using Cactuslisp! Since the Cactus development community is pretty new and the learning curve can be a bit steep, we created a series of tutorials to help you get started. 

The full tutorial articles were published on Medium and can be accessed via the following links: 

**Tutorial 1:** [Introduction to Cactus Smart Coins and Cactuslisp](https://gist.github.com/Kygandomi/081777654bc83bdf5975499363af3f4f)

## A Note on Security
This tutorial is meant as a simple introduction to programming Smart Coins in Cactuslisp. 
As a result, the coins created in these tutorials are NOT fully secured and are just for educational purposes.

Be sure to keep security in mind when extending this project and whenever you develop code that interacts with money on the blockchain as you could brick or lose your coins. Whenever possible start development using the testnetwork, since mistakes can happen! 

## Conclusion

Cactus is a powerful new cryptocurrency and there's a lot of space for new projects to be made! Hopefully, this five part series will help you get started making your own Cactuslisp smart coins! We're excited to see what you create :)
